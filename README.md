glm: An Alias Wavefront OBJ/MTL loading library for OpenGL [![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/devernay/glm.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/devernay/glm) [![Coverity Scan Build Status](https://scan.coverity.com/projects/2943/badge.svg)](https://scan.coverity.com/projects/2943 "Coverity Badge")
===

This is an enhanced version of GLM, which was originally by Nate Robins, with some enhancements by Jeff Rogers (from the GLM_AVL library).

This library loads [OBJ files](http://paulbourke.net/dataformats/obj/) and [MTL files](http://paulbourke.net/dataformats/mtl/), and can display them using OpenGL.

It uses the state-based OpenGL API (up to OpenGL 2.1). If someone wants to contribute OpenGL 3.0 support, please submit a [pull request](https://github.com/devernay/glm/pulls).
